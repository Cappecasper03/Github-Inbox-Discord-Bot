### 9. Build and Run

You have several options to build and run the bot:

# Run the setup script (installs Node.js if needed, installs dependencies, and builds)
./setup.sh
```

#### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the TypeScript code
npm run build

# Start the bot
npm start

# Or run in development mode with auto-reload
npm run dev
```

#### Option 3: Using Helper Scripts
```bash
# Validate your configuration
./validate-config.sh

# Start the bot with the startup script
./start-bot.sh
```

#### Option 4: Run as a System Service
```bash
# Install as a systemd service
./service-manager.sh install

# Start the service
./service-manager.sh start

# Check service status
./service-manager.sh status

# View live logs
./service-manager.sh logs
```

## Configuration Options

| Environment Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | Your Discord bot token | - | ‚úÖ |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Your GitHub personal access token | - | ‚úÖ |

## Usage

Once the bot is running, it will:

1. Check your GitHub notifications every few minutes (configurable)
2. Send new notifications to your Discord channel as rich embeds
3. Provide direct links to the GitHub items
4. Show notification type, reason, and status

## Example Discord Message

The bot sends rich embeds that look like this:

```
üîÄ Add new feature for user authentication
Repository: username/my-awesome-project

Type: üîÄ Pull Request
Reason: üëÄ Review Requested  
Status: üî¥ Unread

Repository Description: An awesome project that does cool things

GitHub Notification ‚Ä¢ Today at 2:30 PM
```

## Helper Scripts

The project includes several helper scripts to make setup and management easier:

- `setup.sh` - Automated setup script that installs dependencies and builds the project
- `validate-config.sh` - Validates your configuration and checks for common issues
- `start-bot.sh` - Starts the bot with proper error handling and logging
- `service-manager.sh` - Manages the bot as a systemd service (install, start, stop, etc.)
- `test-github-api.sh` - Tests your GitHub API connection and token validity

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't start
- Run `./validate-config.sh` to check your configuration
- Check that all required environment variables are set
- Verify your Discord token and GitHub token are valid
- Make sure the Discord channel ID is correct

### No notifications received
- Check that you have GitHub notifications in your inbox
- Verify the GitHub token has the correct scopes (`notifications` and optionally `repo`)
- Check the bot logs for error messages: `./service-manager.sh logs` or check `bot.log`
- Test your GitHub API connection: `./test-github-api.sh`

### Discord messages not sending
- Ensure the bot has permission to send messages in the channel
- Verify the channel ID is correct
- Check that the bot is in the server and has the required permissions

### Permission Issues
- Make sure scripts are executable: `chmod +x *.sh`
- For systemd service, ensure you have sudo privileges

### Installing Node.js
If you don't have Node.js installed, the `setup.sh` script will guide you. You can also install it manually:

```bash
# Using NodeSource repository (recommended)
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Or using snap
sudo snap install node --classic

# Or using nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode with auto-reload
npm run dev

# Build TypeScript
npm run build

# Build and watch for changes
npm run watch

# Test GitHub API connection
npm run test:github

# Validate configuration
npm run validate
```

## Local Usage Notes

This bot is designed for local use on your machine. To get started:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Run the setup script: `./setup.sh`
3. Configure your tokens in the `.env` file
4. Start the bot with `./start-bot.sh`

The bot will run continuously, checking for GitHub notifications and sending them to your Discord channel.
