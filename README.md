## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Method 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

1. **Run the installation script:**
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```
   This automatically:
   - Installs Python 3 and pip3 if missing
   - Creates a virtual environment
   - Installs all dependencies
   - Runs the configuration setup
   - Tests the configuration

2. **Choose your deployment method:**

   **For Development/Testing:**
   ```bash
   ./dev-manager.sh start      # Start bot for development
   ./dev-manager.sh debug      # Run with debug logging  
   ./dev-manager.sh status     # Check development status
   ./dev-manager.sh logs       # View development logs
   ./dev-manager.sh --help     # Show all development commands
   ```

   **For Production (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   ./service-manager.sh install    # Install as systemd service
   ./service-manager.sh start      # Start the service
   ./service-manager.sh status     # Check service status
   ./service-manager.sh logs       # View service logs
   ```

### Method 2: Manual Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure the bot:**
   ```bash
   python setup.py     # Interactive setup
   python test_config.py   # Verify configuration
   ```

3. **Run the bot:**
   ```bash
   # For Development
   ./dev-manager.sh start       # Background execution
   ./dev-manager.sh debug       # Foreground with debug logging
   
   # For Production  
   ./service-manager.sh install # Install as service
   ./service-manager.sh start   # Start the service
   ```

### üêõ Development & Debugging

#### `dev.py` - Development Mode
```bash
python dev.py
```
- Enhanced debug logging
- Console output with timestamps
- Logs to `bot_debug.log`
- Useful for troubleshooting

## üí° Pro Tips

### For Developers
- Use **Development Manager** (`./dev-manager.sh`) for development and testing
- Run `./dev-manager.sh debug` for enhanced debugging with console output
- Test configuration changes with `./dev-manager.sh test`
- Monitor logs in real-time during development with `./dev-manager.sh logs --follow`

### For Production
- Use **Service Manager** (`./service-manager.sh`) for production deployments
- Enable auto-start: `./service-manager.sh enable`
- Set up log monitoring: `./service-manager.sh logs --follow`
- The service automatically restarts if it crashes (10-second delay)

### Performance Optimization
- Adjust `CHECK_INTERVAL` based on your notification volume
- Lower intervals = more real-time, higher API usage
- Higher intervals = less API usage, delayed notifications

## üìà Example Workflows

### First-Time Setup
```bash
# Complete setup in one go
./install.sh                    # Handles everything automatically
./service-manager.sh install    # Set up as service
./service-manager.sh start      # Start running
./service-manager.sh logs       # Verify it's working
```

### Daily Development
```bash
# Start development session
./dev-manager.sh start          # Start bot in development mode
./dev-manager.sh logs --follow  # Monitor in terminal

# Make changes to bot.py
./dev-manager.sh restart        # Restart with changes
# OR
./dev-manager.sh stop           # Stop bot  
./dev-manager.sh start          # Start with changes
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to server
git clone <your-repo>
cd github-inbox-bot
./install.sh                    # Setup everything
./service-manager.sh install    # Install as service
./service-manager.sh enable     # Auto-start on boot
./service-manager.sh start      # Start immediately

# Ongoing maintenance
./service-manager.sh status     # Check health
